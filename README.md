# PySpectralRadar
Python 3 wrapper for Thorlabs SpectralRadar SDK C library using ctypes

This wrapper is intended for use with ThorLabs ThorImage and SpectralRadar
version 4.4.7.0.

It should work with most other 4.X versions with little
to no modification.

ThorImage and SpectralRadar SDK software are the intellectual property of
Thorlabs, Inc. This script is merely a wrapper for the functions and objects
exposed by the SDK they provide to licensed users of this software.

Where possible, wrapper objects and arguments share the name of the
prototype they wrap, as declared in the .h or found in the ThorLabs docs.
